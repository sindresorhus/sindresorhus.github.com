[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback/?product=Photo%20Widget&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### How do I edit a widget?

When on the home screen, long-press on the widget, and select “Edit Widget”. [Read more.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207122)

#### Why can I only add 100 photos to the app?

This is because of a technical limitation in the iOS widget system. Hopefully, it can be increased in the future. It should be enough for most users though.

If you use the “Album” widget, there’s no limit to the number of photos.

#### How can I hide the name of the app shown below the widget?

This is not possible. App developers have no way to hide it.

#### How is this different from the built-in “Photos” widget?

The built-in widget only shows photos from “Memories” and “Featured Photos” in your photo library. There is no way to customize it or pick the photos to be shown.

#### Why is this app free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. I earn money on other apps.
