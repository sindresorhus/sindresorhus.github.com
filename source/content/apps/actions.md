  ### If you just updated to iOS 26, it may take some time for iOS to re-index all the Shortcuts actions. Give it some time.

  ### If the actions don't show up in the Shortcuts app or you get a “com.apple.extensionKit.errorDomain error 2”, [see this](/actions#actions-not-showing-up).<br><br>

  Tip: To pass a variable to a file input in Shortcuts, tap-and-hold (iOS) or right-click (macOS) the input and select the variable.

  **Some actions that are not possible: orientation lock status, flashlight status, ambient sensor info, flight mode status, [and more](/actions#impossible-actions).**
---

The app provides lots (180+) of powerful extra actions for the Shortcuts app on macOS, iOS, and visionOS. These actions make it significantly easier to create shortcuts.

**Restart your device if the actions do not show up in the Shortcuts app. Also try setting a different device language and then back. [Learn more](#actions-not-showing-up)**

If you have any questions about how to use the different actions or for what, try asking the [Actions GPT bot](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6746353a017881918cceb0761aea3bfe-actions-app-companion). And if you want to feed your own AI, [here is the source data](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sindresorhus/fbba65a774fb9da915e624807a02a6d2/raw/7be21a65977b6dd82d1a6cc34be4476df057ea06/actions.md).

#### Impossible actions {#impossible-actions}

Some common actions requests that are not possible:

- Orientation lock status
- Flashlight status
- Ambient sensor info
- Flight mode status
- Hotspot status
- Hotspot connect/disconnect
- All audio playback destinations
- CarPlay connection status
- Notifications in CarPlay

Anything related to changing system features/settings or interacting with other apps is generally not possible.

For these, I recommend sending a [feature request to Apple](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com).

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

Click the feedback button in the app or [send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Actions&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The actions don't show up in the Shortcuts app {#actions-not-showing-up}

This is caused by a iOS/macOS bug.

Some things you could try:

1. Restart your device.
1. Change the device language to something else and back.
1. Add [this shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/14315b9af3774a0c8cb439718a67fb2f), run it once, relaunch Shortcuts, and see if the actions show up in the Shortcuts app after that.
1. Add [this shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e3b39e37d8d6439db9119ebbff626958), copy the action, paste it into a new shortcut, and relaunch Shortcuts.
1. Remove the app, install it again, and restart your device.

*Please don't contact me about this issue. This is a problem with iOS/macOS and out of my control.*

#### I get a “errorDomain error 2” error when running an action

Same solution as above.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps and want this to be available for everyone. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.

#### How can I prevent the app from being offloaded when I have “app offloading” enabled on iOS?

iOS does not have a way to prevent individual apps from being offloaded (even though it should!) and there is no way for apps to tell iOS not to offload them. I recommend [sending feedback to Apple](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com) about this. You could try [this workaround](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/85k8b5/disable_offloading_for_specific_apps/).
