Launch the Touch Bar simulator from anywhere without needing to have Xcode installed, whereas Apple requires you to launch it from inside Xcode. It also comes with a handy transparency slider, a screenshot button, and a service to toggle the Touch Bar in the Services menu or with a keyboard shortcut.
