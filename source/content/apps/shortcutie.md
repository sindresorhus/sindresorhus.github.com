  ### If the actions don't show up in the Shortcuts app or if you get a “com.apple.extensionKit.errorDomain error 2” error when running your shortcut, restart your device. You could also try setting a different device language and then back. If you just updated the operating system, give it some time to re-index all shortcut actions.

  Check the [Actions](/actions) app before requesting an action. It may already exist there.

The app provides lots (70+) of powerful extra actions for the Shortcuts app on macOS.

While my free [Actions](/actions) app provides useful functionality for the Shortcuts app through the App Store for macOS, iOS and visionOS, Shortcutie is a Mac-only app that offers more powerful system-level features by operating outside of Apple's restrictions. This enables capabilities like changing system default browser (without a prompt), getting the active browser tab, clearing notifications, etc. - things that wouldn't be possible under App Store rules.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Restart your device if the actions do not show up in the Shortcuts app. Also try setting a different device language and then back.

Can it be added to Setapp? Setapp curates apps based on demand, so if you'd like to see the app on Setapp, [email them](https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4950254561052-How-to-contact-Setapp-team#:~:text=to%20your%20issue.-,Send%20an%20email,%3A%20support%40setapp.com.) and request its inclusion.

## Tips {#tips}

### Sharing shortcuts that use Shortcutie

Add a warning at the start of the shortcut to install the app if not installed. [Example](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e31f8ce26d36405ca6d6aca0b2350d8f)

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

Click the feedback button in the app or [send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Shortcutie&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The actions don't show up in the Shortcuts app

This is caused by a macOS bug.

Some things you could try:

1. Restart your device.
1. Add [this shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/29943b986f934d9da5018853d4e2cc40), run it once, relaunch the Shortcuts app, and see if the actions show up in the Shortcuts app after that.
1. Change the device language to something else and back.
1. Remove the app, install it again, and restart your device.

#### I get a “errorDomain error 2” error when running an action

Same solution as above.

#### Why is this not in the App Store?

Much of the functionality would not be possible in the App Store because of [sandboxing](/apps/faq#macos-sandbox).

#### Why is this paid when your Actions app is free?

Unlike Actions, which uses public APIs, Shortcutie relies on many private APIs that require constant maintenance as macOS evolves. The app targets power users who value these advanced capabilities, and the pricing helps ensure sustainable development while keeping the support burden manageable.

#### Can I have this installed together with the Actions app?

Yes, they are complementary.

#### Can you support iOS?

No. The app relies on macOS-specific system features that aren't available on iOS and requires capabilities outside of App Store restrictions. Check out [Actions](/actions) for iOS shortcuts functionality.

#### Do I need to keep the app running for the actions to work?

No, once installed, the app's actions are always available to the Shortcuts app.

#### I can already do some of these actions with AppleScript and the command-line, why use this app?

Yes, but the app packages these capabilities into maintained, ready-to-use actions that integrate perfectly with Shortcuts. This lets you focus on building workflows instead of writing and maintaining scripts.

#### How is the “Quit All Apps” action better than the built-in “Quit App” action? {#quit-all-apps-vs-builtin}

The action can exclude the frontmost app and also close Finder windows.

#### What’s up with the app icon?

A bit of whimsy makes software more human and approachable. Even Apple uses a smiling Finder icon to this day. Good software can be both powerful and fun. And since the icon is only visible in the App Store and as a tiny icon in Shortcuts, its design has minimal impact on the actual utility of the app.

#### Shortcutie and Supercharge seem to have some of the same actions for Shortcuts {#supercharge}

There is [some overlap](/supercharge#shortcutie), but Shortcutie includes many more actions. Supercharge only includes actions for its own features.

#### [More FAQs…](/apps/faq)

<!-- ## Older Versions

- [] for macOS 15

These are free for everyone but they will not run on newer macOS versions.
