#### The app does not work {#not-working}

- Ensure you are on the latest version.
- Restart your computer.
- Try [resetting permissions](/apps/faq#mac-reset-permissions).

#### Can you add support for making the camera feed a circle?

I don't plan to add that. I plan to make a separate app specifically for showing the camera on presentations and screencasts, which will have this feature.

#### Can it float over fullscreen apps?

Yes, when in menu bar mode.

#### How is this better than Photo Booth? {#photo-booth}

- Convenient access from the menu bar.
- Toggle it via a keyboard shortcut.
- Higher quality camera output.
- Does not crop the camera output.
- Minimalistic design with no window frame.
- Takes photos without the countdown.
- Photos are saved to the file system, not hidden inside the app.
- The window can be made to always stay on top of other windows.
- Can be accessed from the menu bar.
- Capture and copy photo in a single action.
- Save photo as lossless PNG file.

#### What resources are used when the app is in the menu bar?

When the camera window is closed or minimized, the camera is turned off. The app consumes approximately 40 MB of RAM and 0% of CPU when running in the background.

#### Do you plan to add background removal?

I don't have any immediate plans for this. Maybe in a year when AI background removal has progressed further.

#### Do you plan to add filters?

No

#### Can it record video?

No. That's outside the scope of this app. You can use the built-in QuickTime Player app for that.

<!-- #### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store. -->

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't plan to localize the app.
