AirDrop files and folders simply by dragging them onto the app's menu bar icon.

You can also share directly from your clipboard or use the built-in file picker, both with customizable keyboard shortcuts.

*(Requires macOS 26)*

#### Privacy

The app is built without internet permissions (no network entitlement), so macOS prevents it from connecting to the internet even if it wanted to.

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

Click the feedback button in the app or [send it here.](/feedback?product=Menu%20Drop&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

[Try this](/apps/faq#app-not-showing-in-menu-bar)

#### Can it send directly to a specific device without showing the picker?

No. Apple doesn’t expose any way to preselect an AirDrop target. You must choose a device in the AirDrop picker.

#### Why doesn’t my iPhone/iPad/Mac show up as a target?

AirDrop device discovery is up to the system. Ensure AirDrop is enabled, both devices are unlocked/awake, and are on compatible settings (Contacts Only/Everyone for 10 Minutes).

#### AirDrop is not working

This just triggers the AirDrop picker with the dragged files. It has no control over how AirDrop works.

#### Why use this instead of AirDrop in the Share popover?

Speed. Drag straight to the menu bar.

#### Can you add a menu item or keyboard shortcut to share the current Finder selection with AirDrop?

No. App Store limits (sandboxing) prevent the app from knowing what you’ve selected in Finder.

My [Supercharge](/supercharge) app has a [Finder context menu item](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/gc760wtbraxtgtq3gsrd3/AirDrop-Finder-context-menu-item-Screen-Shot-2025-11-19-at-00.23.31-1763486630.png?rlkey=4qleot753u1cc8xzez26afj0x&raw=1) to send selected files directly to AirDrop.

<!-- My app also has a keyboard shortcut to send the selection to AirDrop -->
