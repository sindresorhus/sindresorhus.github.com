Quickly access a monthly calendar from your menu bar.

Clicking dates and creating events can open either in the Calendar app or Google Calendar.

The app is intentionally simple. Check out [Dato](/dato) for more features and settings.

The calendar displays dates and days in your language, but the rest of the app is in English.

The app does support dimming the weekend though.
