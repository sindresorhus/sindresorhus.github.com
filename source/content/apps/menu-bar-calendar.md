Quickly access a monthly calendar from your menu bar.

Clicking dates and creating events can open either in the Calendar app or Google Calendar.

The app is intentionally simple. Check out [Dato](/dato) for more features and settings.

The calendar displays dates and days in your language, but the rest of the app is in English.

[Try this](/apps/faq#app-not-showing-in-menu-bar)

#### Does it show calendar events?

No. That is outside the scope of the app. My [Today](/today) (free) and [Dato](/dato) (paid) apps have that.

#### Does it support highlighting certain days of the week?

No. Check out my [Dato](/dato) app for that.

The app does support dimming the weekend though.

You can change it with [this system setting](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191445/standard-iso-8601-week-number-in-calendar-app/209340#209340).

#### Why does it show the last days of December as week 1?

That is called [ISO week-numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).

#### It shows the incorrect week number

You are probably expecting [ISO week-numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) while having your system set to [Gregorian week numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Relation_with_the_Gregorian_calendar), or the inverse. You can change it with [this system setting](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191445/standard-iso-8601-week-number-in-calendar-app/209340#209340).

Use my [Velja app](https://sindresorhus.com/velja). You can create a rule to open any link clicked in this app in your chosen browser.

#### How can I scroll to switch months?

You can swipe horizontally to switch months.

If you don't have a trackpad, there are [apps](https://mybyways.com/blog/configure-a-mouse-for-macos-trackpad-like-gestures) that let you make scrolling trigger swipe.
