- Keyboard shortcut to show the menu
- [Shortcuts app integration](#shortcuts)

## Tips

### Browser selector

Set a keyboard shortcut to open the menu. Once open, select a browser by pressing its number key or navigate using the arrow keys.

### Launch browser

Hold the Option key and click a browser in the menu to open it, rather than setting it as the default.

### Switch to specific browser with keyboard shortcut {#keyboard-shortcut-set-browser}

Create a [shortcut in the Shortcuts app](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts-mac/intro-to-shortcuts-apdf22b0444c/mac) for each browser using the “Set Default Browser” action, then assign a keyboard shortcut to the shortcut.

### Automatically switch browser based on a trigger {#auto-switch-browser}

The triggers could be: time, location, active app, Wi-Fi network, etc.

For example, set up automatic browser switching between work and personal use through the Shortcuts app. Create two shortcuts using the “Set Default Browser” action - one for each browser. Then use [Shortery](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1594183810) to automatically trigger these shortcuts based on time of day or Wi-Fi network. The Wi-Fi trigger is particularly useful for office workers, as it switches browsers automatically when you connect to your work network.

Use the [Focus filter](#focus-filter) to switch browser based on the active Focus mode.

On macOS 26 and later, you can use the built-in automation triggers in Shortcuts instead of the Shortery app.

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

Click the feedback button in the app or [send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Default%20Browser&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

[Try this](/apps/faq#app-not-showing-in-menu-bar)

You may also have disabled the “Show menu bar icon” setting, which hides the menu bar icon. Launch the app again to show the menu bar icon.

#### Can it support rules for which browser to use for certain URLs? {#rules-support}

Features like rules require the app to intercept and forward URLs by acting as the default browser. This app simply changes the default browser. Check out my [Velja](/velja) app for rules and more.

#### Can it support browser profiles? {#browser-profiles}

Same answer as the above.

With the exception of Orion, which implements profiles as separate apps.

#### How is it different from your [Velja](/velja) app?

Velja works by acting as a browser and forwarding URLs to other browsers, enabling features like rules, interactive browser prompt, desktop app handling, and URL tracking parameter cleaning. This app is simpler - it just changes the system default browser directly.

#### I already own [Supercharge](/supercharge). Does this offer any benefits over its browser switcher feature? {#supercharge}

- Default browser app icon in the menu bar.
- Larger app icons in the menu.
- Keyboard shortcut to show the menu.
- Number key selection for browsers in the menu.

#### Why is this not in the App Store?

Much of the functionality would not be possible in the App Store because of [sandboxing](/apps/faq#macos-sandbox).

#### Why is it a paid app?

I love making [free apps](/apps/free) and having them available to everyone, but they come with a heavy support burden—I already handle 10–40 app-related emails daily. To focus on quality and sustainability, my new apps will mostly be paid.

#### Can the default browser change based on the macOS desktop Space I’m in? {#macos-spaces}

No. macOS does not expose the active [Space](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/work-in-multiple-spaces-mh14112/mac) to apps, so the app cannot detect or react to it. You can instead automate switching with Focus Filters or Shortcuts (see [tips](#tips)).

#### [More FAQs…](/apps/faq)

<!-- ### Older Versions

- [] for macOS 15

These are free for everyone but they will not run on newer macOS versions.

## Scripting

### Shortcuts

The app comes with support for the Shortcuts app. Look up the app in the Shortcuts app to see what actions it provides.

For example, you could switch to a certain browser at a [specific time of the day](#auto-switch-browser), or maybe when joining a specific Wi-Fi network. For such triggers, you will also need the [Shortery](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1594183810) app.

### Focus filter

The app includes a [Focus filter](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl613dc43f/mac#mchl49b73d04) to automatically switch the default browser based on the Focus mode. Enable it in “System Settings › Focus”.

### Events

The [distributed notification](/apps/faq#distributed-notifications) `com.sindresorhus.defaultBrowserDidChange` is emitted when the default browser is changed from the app or the Shortcuts action.
