Preview how your macOS app icon will look in the Dock and how your menu bar item icon will appear.

The icon previews update automatically when the file changes.

An essential tool for developers and designers to perfect the look of their macOS app icons.

## Tips

#### General

- Drag and drop an image onto the Dock icon or menu bar icon to preview it there.
- Click the Dock icon to pick an icon.
- Right-click the Dock icon while the app is running for more actions.
- In Finder, right-click an image file, and select “Open With › Icon Preview” to set it as the Dock icon. To instead set it as the menu bar icon, press the <kbd>Option</kbd> key while doing this.

#### Preview multiple icons

You can utilize the Shortcuts app to display various icons sequentially, each for three seconds. Add [this shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8824dbd68a8f4dc9a38b850dccd9179e) for app icons or [this one](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/72dcea993b1e4b9686003c8e01133c1b) for menu bar icons. Then, navigate to Finder, select the desired icons, right-click, and select "Quick Actions › Preview App Icons". [Preview](https://x.com/sindresorhus/status/1783036121234165808)
