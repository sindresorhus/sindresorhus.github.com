Preview how your macOS app icon will look in the Dock and how your menu bar item icon will appear.

The icon previews update automatically when the file changes.

An essential tool for developers and designers to perfect the look of their macOS app icons.

### Tips

#### General

- Drag and drop an image onto the Dock icon or menu bar icon to preview it there.
- Click the Dock icon to pick an icon.
- Right-click the Dock icon while the app is running for more actions.
- In Finder, right-click an image file, and select “Open With › Icon Preview” to set it as the Dock icon. To instead set it as the menu bar icon, press the <kbd>Option</kbd> key while doing this.

#### Preview multiple icons

You can utilize the Shortcuts app to display various icons sequentially, each for three seconds. Add [this shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8824dbd68a8f4dc9a38b850dccd9179e) for app icons or [this one](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/72dcea993b1e4b9686003c8e01133c1b) for menu bar icons. Then, navigate to Finder, select the desired icons, right-click, and select "Quick Actions › Preview App Icons". [Preview](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus/status/1783036121234165808)

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

macOS hides menu bar apps when there is no space left in the menu bar. This is a common problem on MacBooks with a notch. Try quitting some other menu bar apps to free up space. If this does not solve it, try quitting Bartender if you have it installed.

#### What image formats are supported for previewing icons?

It supports all common image formats like PNG, SVG, PDF, ICNS, and TIFF.

#### What are the specifications for designing an app icon?

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I do not plan to localize the app.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. I earn money on other apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.
