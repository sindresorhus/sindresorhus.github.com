The app provides additional AI-related actions for the Shortcuts app.

For example, an action to interact with the ChatGPT API.

**The app requires you to specify your own OpenAI API key.**

### macOS version

The macOS version is not yet available on the App Store because App Store review is being difficult. You can get it [here](https://dsc.cloud/sindresorhus/AI-Actions-1.0.2-1695808820.zip) for now. (Requires macOS 13+)

### Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=AI%20Actions&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### Why are these actions not just part of your [Actions](/actions) app?

Apple prevents any app that includes AI-related functionality to be available in China. I didn't want the Actions app to be unavailable in China just because of one action.

#### How is this better than the “Ask ChatGPT” action provided by the official ChatGPT app?

This one works on macOS too, supports longer text, has customizability options for power-users, supports DALL·E 2, and will support more AI APIs in the future.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6465250302) and click “Version History”.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't plan to localize the app.
