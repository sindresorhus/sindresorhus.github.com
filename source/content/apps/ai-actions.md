The app provides additional AI-related actions for the Shortcuts app.

For example, an action to interact with the ChatGPT API.

**The app requires you to specify your own OpenAI API key.**

Your API key is securely stored in your keychain, not in a shortcut.

### macOS version

The macOS version is not yet available on the App Store because App Store review is being difficult. You can get it [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meta/files/12800983/AI.Actions.1.0.3.zip) for now. (Requires macOS 13+)

### Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=AI%20Actions&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### Why are these actions not just part of your [Actions](/actions) app?

Apple prevents any app that includes AI-related functionality from being available in China. I didn't want the Actions app to be unavailable in China just because of one action.

#### How is this better than the “Ask ChatGPT” action provided by the official ChatGPT app?

This one works on macOS too, supports longer text, has customizability options for power-users, supports DALL·E 2, and will support more AI APIs in the future.

#### How is this better than just calling the OpenAI API directly from Shortcuts?

This makes it simpler, but more importantly, it stores your API key securely in the keychain. This means you can share your shortcuts to others without exposing your API key. The API key is not stored in the shortcut.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6465250302) and click “Version History”.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't plan to localize the app.
