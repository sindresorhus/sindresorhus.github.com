### Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Jiffy&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

macOS hides menu bar apps when there is no space left in the menu bar. This is a common problem on MacBooks with a notch. Try quitting some other menu bar apps to free up space. If this does not solve it, try quitting Bartender if you have it installed.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't plan to localize the app.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1502527999) and click “Version History”.

#### Why the name “Jiffy”?

Some people incorrectly pronounce GIF as “Jif”. The name is a pun on that. Also, “Jiffy” means to do something fast, which is what the app is all about.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.
