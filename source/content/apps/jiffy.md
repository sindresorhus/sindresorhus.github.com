**Jiffy is no longer available because Giphy removed their free API.** I may bring it back one day and use the [Tenor](https://tenor.com) API, but it's not something I have time or interest in doing right now.

Jiffy lets you quickly search and discover GIFs from GIPHY. When you have found an awesome GIF, just drag and drop it into an app.

#### Features

- Trending GIFs.
- Search GIFs.
- Use it as a menu bar app or a normal app in the Dock.
- Favorite GIFs and browse/search favorites.
- Global keyboard shortcut to toggle the app.
- Drag and drop a GIF into any app.
- Copy a GIF to the clipboard.
- Launch the app at login.

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

<!-- #### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

Click the feedback button in the app or [send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Jiffy&referrer=Website-FAQ) -->

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

#### Why the name “Jiffy”?

Some people incorrectly pronounce GIF as “Jif”. The name is a pun on that. Also, “Jiffy” means to do something fast, which is what the app is all about.

<!-- #### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store. -->
