Call, message, or email your favorite people directly from the Lock Screen, Home Screen, or desktop.

You can also open a URL or run a shortcut instead when tapping the widget. This opens up a lot of cool possibilities. Here are [some ideas](https://github.com/bhagyas/app-urls) of what you could open.

For macOS, it's only available for Apple silicon Macs running macOS 14 or later.

#### The widget does not show up in the widget picker

This is a well-known iOS issue. [Try this.](https://webtrickz.com/third-party-lock-screen-widgets-not-showing-ios-16/)

#### Can I call someone by just tapping the widget without the confirmation dialog?

Yes. Enable the “Quick Call” setting in the app.

#### Can the Lock Screen photos be full-colored?

This is unfortunately not possible. iOS enforces that Lock Screen widgets are single-colored.

#### Can you support more actions when tapping a widget?

Sure. I'm happy to consider requests. [Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Favorites%20Widget&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### When using the “Run Shortcut” action, why does tapping the widget first open the main app and then the Shortcuts app?

This is because of iOS limitations. A widget can only open its own app when a user taps it. And the only way to run a shortcut is to open the Shortcuts app using a special URL. So when you tap the widget, the widget opens the main app, and the main app then opens the Shortcuts app. It's not a very good user experience, but only Apple can fix this.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. I earn money on other apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1643660089) and click “Version History”.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't plan to localize the app.
