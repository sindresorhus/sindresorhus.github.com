Call, message, or email your favorite people directly from the Lock Screen or Home Screen.

You can also open a URL or run a shortcut instead when tapping the widget. This opens up a lot of cool possibilities. Here are [some ideas](https://github.com/bhagyas/app-urls) of what you could open.

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

Click the feedback button in the app or [send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Favorites%20Widget&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### How do I add the widget?

- [iOS](https://support.apple.com/HT207122)
<!-- - [macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl52be5da5/mac) -->

#### The widget does not show up in the widget picker

This is a well-known iOS issue. [Try this.](https://webtrickz.com/third-party-lock-screen-widgets-not-showing-ios-16/)

#### The Lock Screen widget sometimes disappears

Make sure Lock Screen widgets are allowed when locked: “Settings › Face ID & Passcode › Allow Access When Locked › Lock Screen Widgets”. If it’s “off”, iOS may hide the widget until you unlock.

#### Can I call someone by just tapping the widget without the confirmation dialog?

Yes. Enable the “Quick Call” setting in the app.

#### Can the Lock Screen photos be full-colored?

This is unfortunately not possible. iOS enforces that Lock Screen widgets are single-colored.

#### Can you support more actions when tapping a widget?

Sure. I'm happy to consider requests. [Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Favorites%20Widget&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### Can you make the widget background transparent

This is not possible.

#### When using the “Run Shortcut” action, why does tapping the widget first open the main app and then the Shortcuts app?

This is because of iOS limitations. A widget can only open its own app when a user taps it. And the only way to run a shortcut is to open the Shortcuts app using a special URL. So when you tap the widget, the widget opens the main app, and the main app then opens the Shortcuts app. It's not a very good user experience, but only Apple can fix this.
