Experience the power of [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) as your very own personal assistant, right on your wrist! Get instant answers to any question you have, whether it's explaining complex topics, translating languages, providing recommendations, solving math problems, improving your writing, and so much more. I highly recommend [exploring ChatGPT's capabilities](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=chatgpt+usage+ideas&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) and discovering how it can simplify your life.

The app is in English, but you can ask questions in many languages, including: English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Arabic, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Turkish, Hebrew, Hindi, Bengali, Thai, Greek, Polish, Romanian, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Malay, Swahili, Tagalog, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, and Nepali.

Note that it only has data prior to 2022, so it won't be able to answer questions about recent events.

#### Technical details

The app uses OpenAI's official ChatGPT API. I have to pay for every question, but the app is a one-time purchase since I hate subscription. I sure hope I estimated the price correctly 🤣

### Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I bought the app on my iPhone/iPad but it does not show up on my watch

This is a bug in the App Store. App developers have no control over the install process of apps. Try restarting your watch and if it still does not show up, go into the App Store on your watch and download it there. You will not have to pay again.

#### Can it open the voice dictation directly at launch?

This is unfortunately not possible as watchOS only supports opening the keyboard.

#### Can I choose a voice?

The app automatically uses the best voice for the language used in the answer. Unfortunately, the high-quality Siri voices are not available for apps to use.

#### Can I launch it with the action button?

Add [this shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6b890da159844407a6b39de454567c97) to one of your Apple devices (not the watch), and then on the watch, select the shortcut in the action button configuration.

#### Can you support iOS and macOS too?

Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the app will be available on iOS and macOS. The pricing of the app is based on its expected lifetime usage, and since I am charged for the amount of usage, the cost would be much higher on iOS. For macOS, check out [QuickGPT](/quickgpt).

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6446167837) and click “Version History”.
