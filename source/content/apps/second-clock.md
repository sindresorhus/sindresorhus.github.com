The app is simple by design.

Check out [Dato](/dato) for more features and settings or [UTC Time](/utc-time) if you just need the time in UTC.

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

Click the feedback button in the app or [send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Second%20Clock&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

macOS hides menu bar apps when there is no space left in the menu bar. This is a common problem on MacBooks with a notch. Try quitting some other menu bar apps to free up space. If this does not solve it, try quitting Bartender/Ice if you have it installed.

#### Can it show a flag in front of the time?

You can set a [flag emoji](https://emojipedia.org/flags) in the “Prefix text” setting. [Example.](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus/status/1742975880031543330)

#### Can it show an icon in front of the time?

You can set a [Unicode character](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTips/unicode-symbols.html) or SF Symbol in the “Prefix text” setting.

For an SF Symbol, download the [SF Symbols app](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/), copy a symbol, and paste it into the “Prefix text” setting.

#### Can it show seconds?

No, but you can make the system clock show seconds.

#### Can it show the date?

No. Check out my [Dato](/dato) app for that.

#### Can it show an analog clock?

I have no plans to support that.

#### What if I want more than one additional clock?

I don't plan to support that directly, but here are additional builds of the app with different identifiers so they can all run at the same time:

*Requires macOS 15 or later*

*If you had downloaded this previously and it stopped respecting the chosen time zone, download the new versions above.*

My [Dato](/dato) app supports unlimited time zone clocks with settings like color and size.

#### Can you add text weight and color settings?

This is not planned. The menu bar should generally be monochrome (no colors) and consistent (same text weight).

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

The time output adheres to your locale. I don't plan to localize the app itself.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.
