Gifski is a macOS app for the [gifski encoder](https://gif.ski), which converts videos to GIF animations using [pngquant's](https://pngquant.org) fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.

If you don't have a video, you can try the app out with [this one](https://dsc.cloud/sindresorhus/input-test.mp4).
