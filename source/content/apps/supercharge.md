  Spotify crashes. This is a Spotify bug. [Tell them to fix it.](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Mac/MacOS-Spotify-Crashing-Immediately-on-Startup/td-p/7091821) As a workaround, you can disable ‚ÄúFill window when clicking green traffic light button‚Äù and ‚ÄúHide app when clicking yellow traffic light button‚Äù settings

  If you have moved to a new Mac and need to download the app again, you can download it from your [Gumroad receipt email or Gumroad account](https://gumroad.com/help/article/199-how-do-i-access-my-purchase).

  When reporting bugs, try quitting Supercharge, and if the issue disappears, it is likely not an issue with Supercharge. If the issue is still there, try turning off things in the ‚ÄúTweaks‚Äù settings tab until it does not happen anymore, to narrow down which feature is causing the issue, and let me know.

  If the issue is that a keyboard shortcut is not working, it could be [this](https://sindresorhus.com/apps/faq#secure-input-problem).

  The Finder context menu items will not show up in any [sync folder like iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc](#finder-context-menu-icloud).

<sup>Requires macOS 15.4 or later</sup>

Mentions:
- [Tiny macOS utility apps I love ‚Äì Part 6](https://creativerly.com/tiny-macos-utility-apps-part-6/#supercharge)

[^commandx]: Without this feature, you have to first copy (<kbd>Command+C</kbd>) and then remember to move (<kbd>Option+Command+V</kbd>). The feature works by overriding the normal cut <kbd>‚åòX</kbd> keyboard shortcut when Finder is active and executes a copy <kbd>‚åòC</kbd> instead. When you then paste <kbd>‚åòV</kbd>, it executes the native move <kbd>‚å•‚åòV</kbd> keyboard shortcut. So really, it's Finder moving the files. This app just makes the keyboard shortcuts more intuitive. If you don't paste, the files just stay in place. This feature also works with the Forklift app.

[^quit]: The <kbd>Q</kbd> key is next to <kbd>W</kbd>, making it easy to accidentally hit <kbd>Command+Q</kbd> (quit) when reaching for <kbd>Command+W</kbd> (close window).

[^grayscale]: Grayscale mode on macOS can be a useful tool for various purposes. It can help reduce eye strain during long work sessions, especially in low-light environments. For designers and developers, it's valuable for checking contrast and readability of user interfaces without the influence of color. Content creators may use it to evaluate the tonal balance of images or videos. Additionally, some users find that grayscale helps minimize distractions and improve focus by reducing the visual appeal of non-work-related apps and websites. While initially an adjustment, many users report increased productivity and a more mindful approach to computer usage when employing grayscale mode periodically.

### Features explained

<br>

<!-- ##### Hyper key {#hyper-key}

Remaps <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> to function as a Hyper key‚Äîa single key that simultaneously activates all standard modifiers (Control + Option + Shift + Command). This enables the creation of highly unique shortcuts that are unlikely to conflict with existing ones, making them both easy to remember and quick to use. -->

#### Run shortcuts {#run-shortcuts}

Add shortcuts from the [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts-mac/intro-to-shortcuts-apdf22b0444c/mac) app to the menu for quick access. Show them in the main menu or a submenu. This is especially powerful as shortcuts can run AppleScript and shell scripts.

You can even configure shortcuts to only show up when specific apps are active.

Launch apps, run scripts, automate tasks ‚Äî anything Shortcuts can do, now just one click away.

[Screenshot](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ny886w93chpav0b325ioi/441329057-67290c47-4d78-490f-b0b8-f263ebc1022d-1748012141.png?rlkey=kf2ha9ygkvd4iu3zme8a0wo07&raw=1)

Example shortcuts:
- [Presentation Mode](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c559563486a74b1dafb6ca2cb05e2cb5) - Turns on ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù, keeps screen awake, and hides desktop icons.
- [Toggle ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/17a79c58e70446c5a0f1c1c89653a4aa)
- [Flush DNS cache](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a91b36f037d74cd7a647284e8c376f3d)

**How is this better than the built-in Shortcuts menu bar item?**

- One less menu bar item.
- Closes the menu when running a shortcut.
- Shortcuts can be configured to only show up for specific apps.
- Shortcuts can be shown in a submenu.
- Visually less noisy.

#### Keep awake {#keep-awake}

Prevent your Mac from sleeping and optionally prevent your screen from dimming.

A menu bar icon can be shown when active for visual indication.

For advanced features like timing, check out [Lungo](/lungo).

**Important:** It will not prevent your computer from sleeping if you close the lid (except when connected to power and an external display). This is a macOS safety precaution and out of my control.

**Note:** This will not prevent you from appearing idle in apps like Slack, Teams, or Discord, which track mouse movement to determine activity.

#### Dock icon click behavior {#dock-icon-click-behavior}

By default, clicking an app's Dock icon when the app is active does nothing. With Supercharge, you can make it either hide the app, minimize all its windows, or cycle through the app's windows. This can be particularly useful for quickly clearing your workspace or navigating between windows.

You can also choose to unminimize all windows instead of just one when clicking a Dock icon of an app with minimized windows.

#### Clicking green traffic light button fills window instead of entering fullscreen {#green-traffic-light-button-fill}

Makes clicking the green traffic light button fill the window to fit the screen instead of entering fullscreen mode. Hold <kbd>Option</kbd> while clicking for the default fullscreen behavior. Click again to restore the previous window size.

[Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41dd0f46-05f7-46f2-b9a5-a5ae441da8a9)

*It requires the ‚ÄúDisplays have separate Spaces‚Äù system setting to be enabled because it relies on the window tile functionality, which is only available then.*

#### Clicking yellow traffic light button hides app instead of minimizing window {#yellow-traffic-light-button-hide}

Makes clicking the yellow traffic light button hide the app instead of minimizing the window. Hold <kbd>Option</kbd> while clicking for the default minimize behavior.

#### Prevent accidental window closing for certain apps {#prevent-accidental-window-closing}

Disables the red traffic light button for selected apps to prevent accidentally closing windows. This is particularly useful for apps where you want to be extra careful about not losing your work.

You can hold <kbd>Option</kbd> while clicking the red traffic light button to close the window.

#### Keyboard shortcut inspector {#keyboard-shortcut-inspector}

Detects which apps are listening to or have registered a certain global keyboard shortcut. This is useful for troubleshooting keyboard shortcut conflicts between apps. Simply press any keyboard shortcut combination to see which apps are handling it.

[Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f3ddfaa-caf5-471d-a880-93c97952dada)

#### Automatic clipboard clearing {#automatic-clipboard-clearing}

The clipboard is a common privacy risk as it can retain sensitive content (passwords, credit card numbers, private messages) long after you've copied it. Any app on your Mac can silently read the clipboard at any time.

When enabled, it automatically clears the clipboard:
- About one minute after copying (timer restarts on new copy)
- When your Mac sleeps or locks
<!-- - 10 seconds after pasting with Command+V -->

This ensures sensitive data doesn't linger in your clipboard longer than needed, protecting you from both accidental exposure and malicious apps.

#### Isolate window {#isolate-window}

Hides all other apps and minimizes all other windows of the current app, leaving only the frontmost window visible. It's like a turbocharged ‚ÄúHide Others‚Äù, but also minimizes your extra windows in the current app, so you see just the one you care about.

Perfect for quickly clearing away distractions when you have many windows open (for example, multiple Safari windows across profiles).

Available as a menu action, a customizable keyboard shortcut, and as a Shortcuts action for automations.

#### Add spacers to the Finder sidebar {#finder-sidebar-spacers}

Creates visual separators in the Finder sidebar to help organize your folders into groups. Simply drag the spacer between two folders in the sidebar. The spacer appears as an invisible folder.

*NOTE: The spacer still shows a folder icon. It's not possible to hide this.*

[Screenshot](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7ndp0sdiocgf0n7xdbolz/441615369-d929e3fe-6605-46f6-a99f-6f0f3486a88e-1748012169.png?rlkey=xr7716dr9xiyim0pu80qv6n5x&raw=1)

#### Finder context menu additions {#finder-context-menu}

Adds the following actions (can be customized) directly in the right-click menu in Finder:

- New Text File
	<span class="list-description">Shown only when right-clicking an empty area in Finder.</span>
- New From Template
	<span class="list-description">Creates new files from templates. For example, a Markdown or Excel file. Templates can be organized in subfolders. Click a folder to copy its entire structure, or navigate into it to select individual files. Shown only when right-clicking an empty area in Finder, not a file. Supports dynamic placeholders in filenames (like `Diary {datetime-fixed}` ‚Üí `Diary 2025-02-14 15.30`). And you can even have the file automatically open after naming it. [Screenshot.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb401a0e-2e40-4714-9493-b91563a7b387)</span>
- Open in New Window
	<span class="list-description">Opens the folder in a new window instead of a tab, even if you have set new windows to open as tabs. This action also shows up in the context menu for sidebar items. Useful when you want to view multiple folders side by side or drag items between locations.</span>

*[macOS Services](https://macreports.com/what-is-the-services-menu-in-macos/) are built-in quick actions available in right-click and app menus system-wide. They let you perform tasks like copying file info or text without leaving your current app. Supercharge adds extra, genuinely useful services to make these menus even more powerful.*

#### Capture text from anywhere on screen {#capture-text}

Select any region of your screen to instantly copy the text, even if it's unselectable. Great for extracting text from images, PDFs, presentations, or any other content.

Powered by macOS‚Äô built-in OCR. Text quality and language support depend on the system, not the app.

- [Supported barcodes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vnbarcodesymbology#Supported-Symbologies)

#### Copy message link in Mail {#mail-copy-message-link}

When you are in the Mail app, you can [open the Supercharge menu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cce205b-6743-4a60-958c-074a308ccc68) to copy a direct link to one or more selected messages. You can also set up a keyboard shortcut for this. Copying a message link can be useful if you want to refer to specific emails in other contexts. The link will look like this: `message://%3c66e85e1db33c7_961cfc499cd@lowworker-c6756b946-4rskj.mail%3e`.

#### Copy note link in Notes {#notes-copy-note-link}

When you are in the Notes app, you can [open the Supercharge menu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/028c2952-d708-4eda-ad39-613767532eb7) to copy a direct link to one or more selected notes. You can also set up a keyboard shortcut for this. Copying a note link can be useful if you want to refer to specific notes in other contexts, like in a task manager or calendar event. The link will look like this: `applenotes:note/933C49CC-04F4-5F21-A3EE-2CA93AFC88DD`. When clicked, it opens directly in the Notes app.

#### Close and minimize windows and hide and quit apps directly from Mission Control {#mission-control-improvements}

Enhances Mission Control by letting you close windows or quit apps by right-clicking the hovered window and use keyboard shortcuts (‚åòW, ‚åòQ, ‚åòH, ‚åòM) on the window you are hovering over. This makes window management more efficient as you don't have to exit Mission Control to perform these actions. [Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23c71431-4d3b-4913-b484-3a3f0b7b2b07)

Why not add an ‚ÄúX‚Äù overlay button on previews? Because right-click is faster and easier: you can click anywhere on the preview instead of hunting a tiny target. It keeps Mission Control visually clean, reduces misclicks, and avoids fighting its animations.

#### Dock folder click behavior {#dock-folder-click}

By default, clicking a folder in the Dock shows its contents in a popover. With Supercharge, you can make it directly reveal the folder in Finder instead. Does not work with smart folders.

### For Windows switchers {#from-windows}

Just moved to macOS from Windows? Supercharge helps you feel at home:

- Use <kbd>Command+X</kbd> and <kbd>Command+V</kbd> to move files in Finder ‚Äî just like Cut and Paste in Windows Explorer.
- Quit apps by closing their last window ‚Äî like most Windows apps.
- Fill windows to screen size instead of entering fullscreen ‚Äî matches Windows maximize behavior.
- Hide apps by clicking their Dock icon ‚Äî like minimizing to the taskbar in Windows.
- Press <kbd>Return</kbd> to open files in Finder (rename with <kbd>F2</kbd> or <kbd>Shift+Return</kbd>).
- <kbd>Delete</kbd> moves files to the trash (no need for <kbd>Command+Delete</kbd>).
- Create new text files in Finder with <kbd>Option+N</kbd> or from the right-click menu ‚Äî Just like in Windows Explorer.
- Add ‚ÄúMove To‚Äù and ‚ÄúCopy To‚Äù to Finder‚Äôs right-click menu ‚Äî like in Windows.
- Open Terminal from Finder ‚Äî like ‚ÄúOpen in Terminal‚Äù in Windows Explorer.
- Restore all app windows when focusing an app ‚Äî like taskbar behavior in Windows.
- ‚ÄúDelete Immediately‚Äù in Finder‚Äôs right-click menu ‚Äî like <kbd>Shift+Delete</kbd> in Windows.
- Minimize all windows or all but the frontmost ‚Äî same as <kbd>Win+M</kbd> or <kbd>Win+Home</kbd>.
- Shift-click Dock icons to open a new window ‚Äî just like Shift+clicking taskbar icons.
- <kbd>Command+Q</kbd> (kinda) quits Finder ‚Äî like closing Explorer in Windows.
- Finder shows a new window when activated with no windows open ‚Äî Windows Explorer always shows a window when launched.
- Click Dock folders to open them in Finder ‚Äî like clicking taskbar folders in Windows, which opens Explorer.
- Use <kbd>Delete</kbd> / <kbd>Shift+Delete</kbd> in Safari to go back/forward ‚Äî just like in Windows browsers.
- Invert selection in Finder ‚Äî matches ‚ÄúInvert Selection‚Äù in Windows Explorer.
- Print files from Finder‚Äôs right-click menu ‚Äî like Windows‚Äô right-click ‚ÄúPrint‚Äù.

Make macOS feel less foreign ‚Äî and more powerful.

## Tips

### Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

- Ensure you are on the latest version (click the ‚ÄúCheck for Updates‚Äù button).
- Restart your computer.
- Try closing any anti-virus app you have running as it may [interfere with the app](/apps/faq#secure-input-problem) (or at least disable any Secure Keyboard Entry type setting it may have). And if you don't have any anti-virus app, try closing down all apps and menu bar items, just to rule out some other app interfering. If it's a work computer, your company may have something installed that prevents the app from working.
- Try clicking ‚ÄúReset Permissions‚Äù in the Supercharge menu.

#### Cut and paste files troubleshooting

Ensure you pressed <kbd>Command+X</kbd> and not <kbd>Command+C</kbd>.

To make sure you used the feature correctly, try this: Select a file in Finder, press <kbd>Command+X</kbd>, change to a different folder, press <kbd>Command+V</kbd>. The file should have been moved to this new folder.

**Note:** You cannot cut, highlight a folder, and then paste. You have to actually go into the folder to paste to it. That's just how Finder works. Same with copy-pasting.

If it's still not working, try this: Select a file in Finder, press <kbd>Command+C</kbd>, change to a different folder, press <kbd>Option+Command+V</kbd>. The file should have been moved to this new folder. If this did not work, the problem is not this app, as those are the keyboard shortcuts it simulates.

As a last resort, try [resetting permissions](/apps/faq#mac-reset-permissions) and restarting your computer.

Also try closing any anti-virus app you have running as it may [interfere with the app](/apps/faq#secure-input-problem) (or at least disable any Secure Keyboard Entry type setting it may have). And if you don't have any anti-virus app, try closing down all apps and menu bar items, just to rule out some other app interfering. If it's a work computer, your company may have something installed that prevents the app from working.

### Launch browser

If you have enabled showing browsers in the menu, you can hold the Option key and click a browser in the menu to open it, rather than setting it as the default.

### Tricks

Some things you can already do that you may not know about:

- Hide an app by <kbd>Option</kbd>-clicking on the app's Dock icon.
- Show Control Center by pressing <kbd>Fn+C</kbd>.
- Toggle a specific VPN using a keyboard shortcut with Shortcuts. Add [this shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a0c3171fe98a4379b8197299a84b060e) and set the VPN parameter and a keyboard shortcut.

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

Click the feedback button in the app or [send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Supercharge&referrer=Website-FAQ)

Some things are not possible though:

- [Removing the Trash icon in the Dock.](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/454812/2363)
- Removing the Finder icon in the Dock.
- Disabling Stage Manager animations.
- Fill the entire row with the file's tag color in Finder.
- Naming spaces. Check out [this app](https://github.com/Jaysce/Spaceman) for showing space names in the menu bar.
- Removing or changing Finder context menu items. It can only add items.
- Colored Finder sidebar icons.
- Moving Stage Manager to the right without having the Dock on the left side.
- The "Mission Control tweaks" feature for Stage Manager.

Some things are not planned:

- Memory cleaner
	- Apps like these are a scam. macOS handles memory efficiently. There is no need for an app like this.

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

[Try this](/apps/faq#app-not-showing-in-menu-bar)

You may also have disabled the ‚ÄúShow menu bar icon‚Äù setting, which hides the menu bar icon. Launch the app again to show the main window.

#### I moved to a new computer, how can I download the app again?

If you purchased it on Gumroad, you can download the app again from your Gumroad account or the Gumroad receipt email.

#### The tweaks like Finder cut & paste no longer work

This usually happens when an app [blocks keyboard input reading](/apps/faq#secure-input-problem).

#### Why is Supercharge so expensive? {#price}

- **It's really 10 apps in 1**\
	Supercharge packs dozens of powerful features that would typically require multiple separate apps.
- **One-time purchase, lifetime value**\
	In a world where everything is subscription-based, Supercharge is a one-time purchase with unlimited free updates forever. No monthly fees, no restrictions on how many personal devices you can use it on.
- **Fixes countless macOS annoyances**\
	Apple leaves many frustrating gaps in macOS functionality. Supercharge addresses dozens of these pain points that users encounter daily but Apple hasn't fixed.
- **Complex engineering under the hood**\
	The app performs very difficult technical tasks, from low-level system integration to advanced automation features. Each feature requires significant development effort to work reliably across macOS updates.
- **Dedicated ongoing support**\
	You get responsive support and regular feature additions.
- **Professional quality and reliability**\
	I have been obsessively crafting Mac apps for years.
- **Small market, high development costs**\
	Mac power users are a niche market. The development costs must be spread across fewer users compared to mass-market apps.
- **Support an indie developer**\
	Get actual human support, genuine privacy protection, and a developer who listens to your feedback, unlike faceless corporations where you're just another number. I'm in it for the long haul.

Try the [trial](#trial) and see for yourself.

#### I can already do this with the command-line, BetterTouchTool, Keyboard Maestro, etc.

Supercharge offers a simpler, more user-friendly approach. It's designed for users who want quick access to useful features without the complexity of scripting or configuring advanced tools. Supercharge provides a curated set of enhancements that work right out of the box, saving you time and effort in setup and maintenance. If you prefer more granular control and don't mind the setup process, those other tools might be a better fit for you.

#### Why <kbd>Command+X</kbd>? I can already move files with <kbd>Command+C</kbd> and <kbd>Option+Command+V</kbd>

- It's more logical to cut & paste than copy & move.
- Consistency and muscle memory benefits if you also use Linux or Window.

#### What are Dock spacers? {#dock-spacers}

Dock spacers are [invisible gaps](https://res.cloudinary.com/cpenned/image/upload/f_auto,w_auto/v1636732613/Blog/post-images/20211112-dock.jpg) you can add to your Mac's Dock. They help organize your apps into groups, improving visual clarity. Supercharge lets you easily add these spacers, giving you better control over your Dock's layout.

#### Can I add custom actions to the app?

As of now, the app focuses on providing a curated set of built-in features for enhancing your Mac experience. I'm happy to consider requests.

#### Can you add a certain toggle?

I'm happy to consider requests, but I don't intend for this app to turn into a ‚Äútoggler‚Äù app. I have just provided some commonly needed toggles.

Some toggles I don't plan to add:

- AirPods
- Keep awake *(check out [Lungo](/lungo))*

#### Does the app consume a lot of system resources?

No, the app is optimized to run efficiently in the background with minimal CPU, memory, and battery usage. Most features are event-driven and only activate when needed.

#### I cannot use <kbd>Control+Space</kbd> or <kbd>Control+Shift+Space</kbd> as a keyboard shortcut

Go to ‚ÄúSystem Settings ‚Ä∫ Keyboard ‚Ä∫ Keyboard Shortcuts ‚Ä∫ Input Sources‚Äù and disable them all.

#### Why would I want to clear my clipboard?

Clearing the clipboard helps protect privacy by removing potentially sensitive information (like passwords or personal data) that might otherwise remain available for pasting. Any app can silently read the clipboard. And you could also accidentally paste it somewhere you didn't intend to.

#### Why don‚Äôt the Finder context menu items show up in iCloud, Dropbox, and OneDrive folders? {#finder-context-menu-icloud}

Finder Sync extensions, which power these context menu items, are intended to add sync functionality for third-party services in Finder. Since iCloud, Dropbox, and OneDrive folders have their own built-in sync, macOS doesn't allow the Supercharge extension in these locations to prevent conflicts.

Some of the Finder context menu items are also available as [macOS services](#macos-services), which do show up in synced folders.

#### I am seeing incorrect icons for external drives in the Finder sidebar when enabling context menu items

This is a macOS bug and out of my control. When context menu items are enabled for external volumes, macOS shows document icons instead of drive icons in the Finder sidebar. As a workaround, you can disable showing the context menu items on external drives.

#### How can I add my preferred apps to the ‚ÄúOpen Folder With‚Äù Finder context menu? {#add-app-open-folder-with}

The menu shows apps that declare support for opening folders. This is controlled by app developers, not by Supercharge. To get your preferred apps to appear in this menu, contact the developers of those apps and request them to add folder opening support.

The developer will need to add `public.folder` to `LSItemContentTypes` in their app's Info.plist:

```xml
<key>LSItemContentTypes</key>
<array>
		<string>public.folder</string>
</array>
```

*(If the app already contains `public.directory`, it will still have to add `public.folder`)*

[Example report.](https://github.com/coteditor/CotEditor/issues/1809)

If you know the app supports opening folders but it doesn't show up, it may be that the app has not properly declared support for it. Contact the app developer about adding the above. You could also [contact me](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Supercharge), and I can manually add the app.

#### Can you add support keyboard shortcuts to change default browser?

Maybe. For now, you can make a shortcut in the Shortcuts app, give it a keyboard shortcut, and use the ‚ÄúSet Default Browser‚Äù Shortcuts action that comes with Supercharge.

#### Can you add more features to changing the default browser, like rules?

Features like rules require the app to intercept and forward URLs by acting as the default browser. This is out of scope for this app. Check out my [Velja](/velja) app for that.

#### Why do some tweaks have a list of pre-defined keyboard shortcuts instead of a shortcut recorder?

The pre-defined shortcuts are intentionally curated to help users quickly select sensible shortcuts that won't conflict with built-in app shortcuts. This approach reduces potential support issues. Missing a useful key combination? Let me know, and I will consider adding it.

#### Can you add a Finder keyboard shortcut to move selected items into a new folder?

This is already supported natively. See the ‚ÄúFile ‚Ä∫ New Folder with Selection‚Äù menu item. Select some items and then press <kbd>Control+Command+N</kbd>. You can change the keyboard shortcut in the [System Settings](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/create-keyboard-shortcuts-for-apps-mchlp2271/mac).

#### Can the app support clearing clipboard formatting? {#pure-paste}

Check out my [Pure Paste](/pure-paste) app for this. I think it makes more sense as a separate app.

#### How can I copy the original text in the translate popover?

The translate popover is provided by macOS and does not support copying the original text. As a workaround, select the same language as the destination language, and then click ‚ÄúCopy Translation‚Äù.

#### How can I run the actions from Raycast or Alfred?

Most of the actions are exposed as Shortcuts actions, so create a shortcut with the action and run it from Raycast or Alfred.

#### Can I trigger the actions using a custom URL scheme?

It's something I plan to support at some point, but for now, you can use Shortcuts, as mentioned above.

#### Can the app support hiding menu bar items?

No, that's out of scope for this app. I recommend [Ice](https://icemenubar.app).

#### Can you add Alt-Tab functionality like Windows?

No, this would be very complex to implement well and there is already an excellent free app called [AltTab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app) that does exactly this.

#### Supercharge and Shortcutie seem to have some of the same actions for Shortcuts

There is some overlap, but [Shortcutie](/shortcutie) includes many more actions. Supercharge only includes actions for its own features.

#### Why is this not in the App Store?

Much of the functionality would not be possible in the App Store because of [sandboxing](/apps/faq#macos-sandbox).

#### [More FAQs‚Ä¶](/apps/faq)

<!-- Intentionally using the wrong header level so it doesn't show up as a main thing. -->

### Scripting

#### Events

The [distributed notification](/apps/faq#distributed-notifications) `com.sindresorhus.defaultBrowserDidChange` is emitted when the default browser is changed from the app or the Shortcuts action.
