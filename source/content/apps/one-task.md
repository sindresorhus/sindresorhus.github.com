Show a single task on your Home Screen, Lock Screen, or desktop.

Add some tasks to the app and then add the widget. Simply tap the widget to mark the task as completed. The next task will then appear.

The simplicity is a feature. The app will not have things like folders, tags, priority, notes, etc.

The optimal workflow in One Task is to add only the tasks you're committed to completing today. The app is designed for task completion, not endless organization and neglect.

It syncs tasks over iCloud. Note that the macOS version has an issue where it doesn't sync while being the active window (macOS bug).

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=One%20Task&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### How is this different from your [One Thing](/one-thing) app?

One Thing lets you put a single piece of text in the menu bar. This app is focused on tasks, and allows you to queue multiple tasks, and check them off upon completion. This app is also available on iOS and uses widgets instead of the menu bar.

#### Does the app integrate with other todo apps?

No, One Task deliberately avoids automatic integration with other todo apps. Most todo apps encourage task hoarding, leading to overwhelm and inaction. One Task focuses on actionable items you commit to completing within the day. Manually select your highest-priority tasks and add them to One Task for focused execution.

#### Does the app support task templates?

No, but you can achieve this using the Shortcuts app. Modify [this shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/51edae78b820457a89d12715a053fac6) and run it every time you want to apply the template tasks. You could even add the shortcut to the Home Screen.

#### Why doesn't the app have folders, tags, or priorities?

One Task is designed for action, not endless categorization. It omits features like folders, tags, and priorities to eliminate distractions and decision fatigue. The app's core functionality is to help you commit to and complete tasks today.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6465745322) and click “Version History”.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't plan to localize the app.
