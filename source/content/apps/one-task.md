Show a single task on your Home Screen, Lock Screen, or desktop.

Add some tasks to the app and then add the widget. Simply tap the widget to mark the task as completed. The next task will then appear.

The simplicity is a feature. The app will not have things like folders, tags, priority, notes, etc.

The optimal workflow in One Task is to add only the tasks you're committed to completing today. The app is designed for task completion, not endless organization and neglect.

<!-- Syncs seamlessly across your devices with iCloud. -->

It syncs tasks over iCloud. Note that the macOS version has an issue where it doesn't sync while being the active window (macOS bug).

It's an [Universal Purchase](/apps/faq#universal-purchase).

## Tips

### Import tasks from other todo apps

You can quickly import tasks from other todo apps by copying the tasks from such apps into One Task with the “Tasks: Paste” button.

For example, on macOS, select the tasks you want in Reminders or Things, right-click and copy them, and then paste them into One Task using the “Tasks: Paste” button.

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

Click the feedback button in the app or [send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=One%20Task&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### How is this different from your [One Thing](/one-thing) app? {#one-thing-difference}

One Thing is a minimalist note app that sits in the menu bar, displaying a single piece of text like a sticky note. In contrast, One Task is a task management tool that lets you queue multiple tasks, check them off upon completion, and view them one at a time, with a strong emphasis on widgets. While both apps share a focus on simplicity, One Thing is designed for quick, single-note access, whereas One Task is geared towards managing multiple tasks with a more structured approach, similar to the difference between the Notes app and Reminders app.

#### iCloud syncing does not work

[Troubleshooting.](/apps/faq#icloud-sync)

Known issue:
- Because of a macOS bug, the macOS app does not sync with iCloud while it's focused.

#### How can I edit an item?

Swipe right on the item.

On macOS, you can also right-click the item.

#### Does the app integrate with other todo apps?

No, One Task deliberately avoids automatic integration with other todo apps. Most todo apps encourage task hoarding, leading to overwhelm and inaction. One Task focuses on actionable items you commit to completing within the day. Manually select your highest-priority tasks and add them to One Task for focused execution.

#### Does the app support recurring tasks? {#recurring-tasks}

No. I want to keep this app super simple.

However, you can achieve this using the Shortcuts app. Create a [shortcut](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) that uses the “Add Task” action to add the tasks you want to be recurring. Then create an [automation](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/apdfbdbd7123/7.0/ios/17.0) to run the shortcut at a certain interval. For example, every morning.

*(macOS does not yet have automations. You can use [Shortery](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1594183810) for now.)*

#### Does the app support task templates? {#task-templates}

No, but you can achieve this using the Shortcuts app. Modify [this shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/51edae78b820457a89d12715a053fac6) and run it every time you want to apply the template tasks. You could even add the shortcut to the Home Screen.

#### Why doesn't the app have folders, tags, or priorities?

One Task is designed for action, not endless categorization. It omits features like folders, tags, and priorities to eliminate distractions and decision fatigue. The app's core functionality is to help you commit to and complete tasks today.

#### How can I turn off iCloud syncing? {#turn-off-sync}

- **macOS:** Go to “System Settings › Apple Account › iCloud › Saved to iCloud” and turn off One Task.
- **iOS:** Go to “Settings › Apple Account › iCloud › Saved to iCloud” and turn off One Task.

It will erase your existing items, so you may want to first back them up with “Tasks: Copy” in the app.

#### Can you add a widget setting to choose background color?

I don't plan to add this. I want to keep the app super simple.

#### Can you make the widget background transparent

This is not possible.

#### The text in the widget is quite large

The text automatically scales down to fit more content.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't plan to localize the app.
