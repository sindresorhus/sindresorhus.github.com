  If you're having problems with the Shortcuts app showing an error when trying to open an app, this is a problem with the Shortcuts app and out of my control. Try restarting your device and then try changing the system language to something else and then back. That sometimes fixes such issues. Otherwise, just give it some time. Sometimes the system needs some time after a system update to refresh everything.

Quickly open websites, launch apps, and run shortcuts directly from your Lock Screen.

For example, open google.com, launch TikTok, or run a shortcut to play a random music playlist.

Here are [some more ideas](https://github.com/bhagyas/app-urls) of what you could open.

#### Can the Lock Screen widgets be full-colored?

This is unfortunately not possible. iOS enforces that Lock Screen widgets are single-colored.

#### Can you support more actions when tapping a widget?

Sure. I'm happy to consider requests. [Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Quick%20Launch&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### How does it compare to other similar Lock Screen launchers?

It can open any app, not just from a predefined list, and it has more icon choices.

#### When using the “Run Shortcut” action, why does tapping the widget first open the main app and then the Shortcuts app?

This is because of iOS limitations. A widget can only open its own app when a user taps it. And the only way to run a shortcut is to open the Shortcuts app using a special URL. So when you tap the widget, the widget opens the main app, and the main app then opens the Shortcuts app. It's not a very good user experience, but only Apple can fix this.
