This app provides support functionality for [my apps](/apps). It offers easy ways to export/import (backup/transfer) settings, reset privacy permissions, and more. It's a separate app because some features are not possible in sandboxed apps, which most of my apps are.

I welcome suggestions for what more useful support tools it could contain.

*I also have future plans to make this app provide extra functionality for my sandboxed apps.*

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

Click the feedback button in the app or [send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=App%20Buddy&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### Can it support apps other than yours?

No. This is intended for my apps only.

If you need app setting import/export for any apps, check out my [Supercharge](/supercharge) app.

#### Why is this not in the App Store?

Much of the functionality would not be possible in the App Store because of [sandboxing](/apps/faq#macos-sandbox).
