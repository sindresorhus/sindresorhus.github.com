# Frequently Asked Questions

*See the page of each app for app-specific FAQs.*

### How can I report a bug or suggest a feature?

Tap the feedback button in the app or the support link on the app's page. I prioritize bug fixes and consider feature suggestions that align with the app's vision and user demand.

### Do your apps collect any personal data?

My apps prioritize user privacy and do not collect any personal data.

### How can I get a refund?

For apps purchased on the Apple App Store, you can [request a refund](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084). However, I would appreciate if you [reached out](/feedback) first. I may be able to resolve any problems you are having.

### How many devices can I install an app on?

Apps purchased on the Apple App Store can be installed on up to 10 devices, with a maximum of 5 computers. [Learn more.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204074)

### How can I transfer an app bought on the Apple App Store to a different account?

This is unfortunately [not possible](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/444878). App developers have no control over the purchase process on the Apple App Store.

### Are your apps native?

Yes, all my apps are native. They are built using Swift and SwiftUI and are designed to provide the best performance and integration with the operating systems. I put a lot of effort into adhering to Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines).

### Why are most of your apps free?

I love making apps and I want them to be available to as many people as possible. I don't care much about money and I earn enough on my paid apps.

### Why should I trust you?

Free apps often raise doubts about privacy and intentions. Your trust matters deeply to me. Unlike others, I don't engage in data-selling or bombard you with pesky ads. Your privacy is sacred; you are not my product. I make apps because I enjoy it. I don't care about profits.

With over 3 million users placing their confidence in me, I take pride in safeguarding their devices and respecting their privacy. Moreover, my reputation speaks volumes. Tens of thousands of developers also rely on [my code](https://github.com/sindresorhus).

Trust is earned. Don't just take my word for it; delve into the reviews on the App Store. Your peace of mind matters, and I'm committed to upholding it every step of the way. Feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you have any questions.

### What's your policy on ads in your apps?

I hate ads. None of my apps have ads.

### How can I support your work?

Rate and review my apps on the App Store. Your ratings and reviews greatly aid in increasing the apps' visibility and discoverability, helping more users find them.

### Who makes your app icons?

I make them myself in Sketch, sometimes using AI as a starting point.

### How do you prioritize bug fixes?

User-reported bugs are prioritized based on their impact on the app's functionality and the number of users affected. My goal is to fix **all** bugs.

### What's the best way to learn about new apps?

Subscribe to my [“new apps” RSS feed](/rss-apps.xml) and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@sindresorhus).

### Do you actively maintain all your apps?

Yes, I actively maintain all my apps to ensure they remain awesome and bug free. Every year, I make sure they take advantage of Apple's latest technologies.

### The app hasn't been updated in a while, is it still maintained?

Yes, if an app has not been updated for months, it's still actively maintained. A lack of recent updates indicates that the app has reached a mature and stable state.

### Why do you only support the latest macOS/iOS version?

I make apps for fun and supporting older operating system versions is simply no fun. It adds a lot of overhead with having to test each update on the older versions, work around bugs Apple will never fix, etc. As a compromise, I provide older versions of my apps for older operating system versions.

### How can I export, import, sync, or back up the settings in a Mac app?

[See this guide.](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/main/backup-app-settings.md)

### Can I contribute localizations to your apps?

No, I don't plan to localize my apps. Localization adds complexity and maintenance demands that detract from my focus on app quality and performance.

### You are doing a lot of open source, why are only some of your apps open source? {#why-not-oss}

I open source [some of my apps](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Asindresorhus+language%3Aswift+topic%3Aapp+archived%3Afalse), but not all, for a few key reasons. First, I use specialized tools (internal framework) to speed up app development, which are not suitable for sharing. Additionally, past experiences with open sourcing apps have led to clones of my apps appearing on the App Store, which is problematic. Also, community contributions, though well-intentioned, often don't match the high quality standards I set for my apps. As a compromise, I tend to open source the [reusable building blocks](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Asindresorhus+topic%3Aswift-package+archived%3Afalse), allowing community involvement while maintaining the quality and uniqueness of my apps.

### I'm having a problem with your app {#app-problem}

Here are some things you could try:

- Restart your device.
