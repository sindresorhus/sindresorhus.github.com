# Frequently Asked Questions

*See the page of each app for app-specific FAQs.*

### How can I report a bug or suggest a feature?

Tap the feedback button in the app or the support link on the app's page. I prioritize bug fixes and consider feature suggestions that align with the app's vision and user demand.

### Do your apps collect any personal data?

My apps prioritize user privacy and do not collect any personal data.

### How can I get a refund? {#refund}

For apps purchased on the Apple App Store, you can [request a refund](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084) from Apple. App developers have no control over the purchase and refund process.

For apps purchased on Gumroad, there is generally no refund. You can [request a refund](mailto:sindresorhus@gmail.com?subject=Gumroad%20refund&body=Mention%20which%20app%20you%20want%20a%20refund%20for%20and%20your%20Gumroad%20account%20email) if you have a good reason (like duplicate purchase). But most purchases are final.

<!-- For apps purchased on Gumroad, you can [request a refund](mailto:sindresorhus@gmail.com?subject=Gumroad%20refund&body=Mention%20which%20app%20you%20want%20a%20refund%20for%20and%20your%20Gumroad%20account%20email) within 30 days of the purchase. -->

However, I would appreciate if you [reached out](/feedback) first. I may be able to resolve any problems you are having.

### How many devices can I install an app on?

Apps purchased on the Apple App Store can be installed on up to 10 devices, with a maximum of 5 computers. [Learn more.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204074)

Apps purchased on Gumroad can be used by one user on unlimited computers.

### How can I transfer an app bought on the Apple App Store to a different account?

This is unfortunately [not possible](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/444878). App developers have no control over the purchase process on the Apple App Store.

### Can I get an invoice?

Apps purchased on:

- [Apple App Store](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/425441/invoice-for-purchases-made-on-app-store)
- [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/help/article/194-i-need-an-invoice.html#How-to-generate-your-invoice-from-the-receipt-wpmBD)

### Do you provide any discounts?

Yes. See the [discounts](/apps/discounts) page.

### What is Universal Purchase on the App Store? {#universal-purchase}

An App Store feature that lets you buy an app once and get access to all its available versions across Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS) using the same Apple ID. For example, if you buy a Universal Purchase app on your iPhone, you can download it on your Mac at no extra cost if a Mac version exists. All my apps on the App Store are Universal Purchase.

### Can your app be available on Setapp? {#setapp}

Setapp curates apps based on demand, so if you'd like to see an app of mine on Setapp, [email them](https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4950254561052-How-to-contact-Setapp-team#:~:text=to%20your%20issue.-,Send%20an%20email,%3A%20support%40setapp.com.) and request its inclusion.

### Are your apps native?

Yes, all my apps are native. They are built using Swift and SwiftUI and are designed to provide the best performance and integration with the operating systems. I put a lot of effort into adhering to Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines).

### Why are most of your apps free?

I love making apps and I want them to be available to as many people as possible. I don't care much about money and I earn enough on my paid apps.

### Why should I trust you?

Free apps often raise doubts about privacy and intentions. Your trust matters deeply to me. Unlike others, I don't engage in data-selling or bombard you with pesky ads. Your privacy is sacred; you are not my product. I make apps because I enjoy it. I don't care about profits.

With over 3 million users placing their confidence in me, I take pride in safeguarding their devices and respecting their privacy. Moreover, my reputation speaks volumes. Tens of thousands of developers also rely on [my code](https://github.com/sindresorhus).

Trust is earned. Don't just take my word for it; delve into the reviews on the App Store. Your peace of mind matters, and I'm committed to upholding it every step of the way. Feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you have any questions.

### What's your policy on ads in your apps?

I hate ads. None of my apps have ads.

### How can I support your work?

Rate and review my apps on the App Store. Your ratings and reviews greatly aid in increasing the apps' visibility and discoverability, helping more users find them. You can also rate my apps on Gumroad.

### Who makes your app icons?

I make them myself in Sketch, sometimes using AI as a starting point.

### How do you prioritize bug fixes?

User-reported bugs are prioritized based on their impact on the app's functionality and the number of users affected. My goal is to fix **all** bugs.

### What's the best way to learn about new apps?

Subscribe to my [“new apps” RSS feed](/feeds) and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@sindresorhus).

### Do you actively maintain all your apps?

Yes, I actively maintain all my apps to ensure they remain awesome and bug free. Every year, I make sure they take advantage of Apple's latest technologies.

### The app hasn't been updated in a while, is it still maintained?

Yes, if an app has not been updated for months, it's still actively maintained. A lack of recent updates indicates that the app has reached a mature and stable state.

### Why do you only support the latest macOS/iOS version?

I make apps for fun and supporting older operating system versions is simply no fun. It adds a lot of overhead with having to test each update on the older versions, work around bugs Apple will never fix, etc. As a compromise, I provide [older versions](/apps/older-versions) of my apps for older operating system versions.

### Why do you create multiple mini menu bar apps instead of one comprehensive “menu bar app”?

- **Focus:** Easier to make a high-quality app when it's focused on one thing.
- **Marketing:** Challenging to market an app that does too many different things.
- **Customization:** Users can install only what they need.
- **Isolation:** Issues in one app don’t affect others.
- **Satisfaction:** I like the satisfaction of completing an app.

### How can I export, import, sync, transfer, or back up the settings for your Mac app? {#export-settings}

You can do it with my [App Buddy](/app-buddy) app.

If you prefer using the command-line, [see this guide.](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/main/backup-app-settings.md#command-line)

### Can I contribute localizations to your apps? {#localize}

No, I don't plan to localize / translate my apps. Localization adds complexity and maintenance demands that detract from my focus on app quality and performance.

### Can you make your apps available on Homebrew? {#homebrew}

For App Store apps, unfortunately not. Supporting Homebrew requires distributing apps outside the App Store, and that involves significant overhead: hosting, auto-updating, and dual publishing. The demand simply doesn't justify these efforts.

For non-App Store apps, anyone can add to Homebrew. Feel free to [add one of my apps](https://docs.brew.sh/Adding-Software-to-Homebrew). I personally don't use Homebrew for apps, so it's not something I plan to do.

### You are doing a lot of open source, why are only some of your apps open source? {#why-not-oss}

I open source [some of my apps](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Asindresorhus+language%3Aswift+topic%3Aapp+archived%3Afalse), but not all, for a few key reasons. First, I use specialized tools (internal framework) to speed up app development, which are not suitable for sharing. Additionally, past experiences with open sourcing apps have led to clones of my apps appearing on the App Store, which is problematic. Also, community contributions, though well-intentioned, often don't match the high quality standards I set for my apps. As a compromise, I tend to open source the [reusable building blocks](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Asindresorhus+topic%3Aswift-package+archived%3Afalse), allowing community involvement while maintaining the quality and uniqueness of my apps.

### How can I uninstall your app? {#uninstall-app}

macOS: Ensure the app is not running. Open Finder, go to the “Go” menu, and select “Applications”. Find the app and drag it into the trash.

iOS: Tap and hold the app on the Home Screen and select “Remove App”.

*If you're uninstalling due to issues, please [contact me](/feedback) first; I resolve problems quickly.*

### I'm getting a “The application can’t be opened” error when trying to launch your app

Make sure the app is in the “/Applications” folder, then right-click the app and select "Open" from the context menu.

If it still doesn't work, the app may be quarantined, and the system is not showing the proper dialog. To fix this, open Terminal and run:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine -r /Applications/AppName.app
```

Replace `AppName` with the name of the app. [Learn more.](https://superuser.com/a/28400/6877)

### Your app is using a lot of CPU {#high-cpu}

If you notice high CPU usage for one of my apps in Activity Monitor, don't be alarmed. [CPU usage numbers can be misleading](https://eclecticlight.co/2022/02/24/cpu-percentage-is-misleading-on-m1-macs/), especially on modern Apple Silicon Macs. Here's why:

- The percentage shown is the total across all CPU cores. For example, on an 8-core Mac, 10% usage of a single core only represents about 1.5% of total capacity
- Activity Monitor doesn't distinguish between efficiency (E) and performance (P) cores
- Many background tasks run on efficient low-power cores, minimizing battery impact
- The CPU percentage updates every 5 seconds by default, so even brief spikes appear longer

For a more accurate assessment, look at the “CPU Time” column in Activity Monitor instead of the CPU percentage. This shows the actual processor time used by the app. If you notice unusual battery drain, please [contact me](/feedback) as there might be an actual issue to investigate.

### How do I find the bundle identifier of a Mac app? {#find-bundle-identifier}

To get the bundle identifier of an app, run the following in the Terminal app:

```sh
osascript -e 'id of app "AppName"'
```

Replace `AppName` with the name of the app.

For my apps, you can also find it in [App Buddy](/app-buddy).

### What is a bundle identifier? {#bundle-identifier}

A bundle identifier (or bundle ID) uniquely identifies an app in Apple's ecosystem, using a reverse-domain format like `com.companyname.appname`. For example, `com.sindresorhus.Dato` for [Dato](/dato).

### What is the macOS app sandbox? {#macos-sandbox}

The macOS app sandbox is like putting each app in a fenced yard. It keeps the app from wandering off and messing with other apps or your system, which makes your Mac safer. However, the fence is very strict—it can stop apps from doing creative or powerful things, even when you want them to. All apps on the Mac App Store must be sandboxed, which means some advanced features or workflows might not be possible.

### What are distributed notifications? {#distributed-notifications}

[Distributed notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/distributednotificationcenter) is a communication mechanism on macOS that allows apps to send invisible system-wide signals that other apps can listen to. When one app sends a notification, another app can wait for it and then do something.

For example, [Dato](/dato) sends a distributed notification when you join a video call, which other apps can listen for and do something when it happens. And [Default Browser](/default-browser) sends a distributed notification when the default browser is changed.

To listen to such notifications, you could use the “Wait for Distributed Notification” action in the [Actions](/actions) app or use [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai).

### I have enabled “launch at login” but the app does not launch when I start my computer {#launch-at-login-not-working}

When you enable that setting, the app simply tells macOS to launch it at login, so if it's not working, it's a problem with macOS or your system. As a workaround, you can manually add it: Open System Settings, go to “General › Login Items”, and click the “+” button, and choose the app.

### I'm having a problem with your app {#app-problem}

Here are some things you could try:

- Restart your device.
- Ensure you are on the latest version of the app.
- Ensure you are on the latest operating system version.
- Check the FAQ on the app's page in case it's already answered there.
- If the app requires an internet connection, make sure you are online. Try disabling any VPN.
- macOS: Close all other apps (including menu bar items) to make sure the problem is not caused by another app.
- macOS: [Reset permissions.](#mac-reset-permissions)
- [Reset the app.](#reset-app)

For sync issues, see below.

If you have tried all of this, [contact me](/feedback).

### iCloud syncing is not working {#icloud-sync}

- Ensure iCloud sync is enabled in the app settings on all devices you wish to sync.
- Ensure all devices are signed into the same iCloud account.
- Ensure all devices are online.
- Ensure your iCloud storage is not full.
- Try restarting all devices.
- Force a manual sync by making a small edit to the synced data on one device.
- The initial sync may take a while.
- Resolve any Apple Account or iCloud errors on your devices (e.g., sign-in prompts).
- Ensure Low Power Mode is not enabled on the devices. It can cause iCloud to delay syncing.
- Ensure you are on the latest operating system version and app version.
- On iOS, ensure the app is not disabled in “Settings › Apple Account › iCloud › Apps Using iCloud”.
- On macOS, ensure the app is not disabled in “System Settings › Apple Account › iCloud › Saved to iCloud” and “System Settings › Apple Account › iCloud › iCloud Drive › Apps syncing to iCloud Drive”.
- If using a VPN, try disconnecting it, as some VPNs can interfere with iCloud syncing.
- If it's a work device, make sure there are no restrictions in place that prevent iCloud or iCloud Drive.
- Check the [iCloud system status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) to ensure the service is not experiencing issues.

##### Keyboard shortcuts or text expansion suddenly stopped working {#secure-input-problem}

If keyboard shortcuts or text expansion suddenly stops working, it's likely because an app is using Secure Input - a macOS security feature that blocks other apps from reading keystrokes. While this is intended for sensitive contexts like password fields, apps sometimes fail to properly disable it. Common culprits are password managers like Bitwarden and 1Password, even when running in the background. Safari can also sometimes cause this.

You can try:
1. Quit password managers and browsers.
1. Quit all apps.
1. Putting the computer to sleep and then waking it up and logging in again usually fixes it.
1. If nothing else works, restart your computer.
1. Use the “Get Apps Using Secure Input” action from [Shortcutie](/shortcutie) to identify the problematic app and quit it.

The issue often occurs when an app requests Secure Input while in the background, causing it to get "stuck" in secure mode.

### How can I send you debug info for one of your apps? {#debug-info}

macOS: Make sure the app is not running (you can force-quit it from the Activity Monitor app) and then press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd> while launching the app.

iOS: In the app, tap the “Share App” button (usually found in settings), triple tap on the QR code, and then tap “Send Debug Info to Developer”.

### How can I delete all settings and data to start over in one of your apps? {#reset-app}

macOS: Make sure the app is not running (you can force-quit it from the Activity Monitor app) and then press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Command</kbd> while launching the app.

iOS: Open the Settings app, go to “General › iPhone/iPad Storage”, tap the app in the list, tap “Delete App”, then go to the App Store and install the app again.

### How can I reset all permissions for your Mac app? {#mac-reset-permissions}

*(This is only necessary if the app asked for any permissions the first time you launched it)*

**The simple way**

Select the app in [App Buddy](/app-buddy) and click “Reset Permissions”.

**The manual way**

First, quit the app.

Copy the following, open the Terminal app, paste it into the Terminal window, replace `<app-name>` with the name of the app, and then press the <kbd>Return</kbd> key:

```sh
osascript -e 'id of app "<app-name>"'
```

Example:

```sh
osascript -e 'id of app "Dato"'
```

You now have the app's identifier.

Next, copy the following, and paste it into the Terminal window, replace `<app-identifier>` with the app's identifier, and then press the <kbd>Return</kbd> key:

```sh
tccutil reset All <app-identifier>
```

Example:

```sh
tccutil reset All com.sindresorhus.Dato
```

You can now launch the app again.

### How can I send you a crash report for one of your apps? {#crash-report}

**macOS - simple**

Select the app in [App Buddy](/app-buddy) and click “Copy to Downloads” in the “Crash Reports” section.

**macOS - manual**
- Open Finder
- Select `Go to Folder…` from the `Go` menu
- Enter: `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`
- In the resulting list, select all files that starts with the app name, ZIP them, and [send me](/feedback)

### Can you add AppleScript support to your apps? {#applescript}

No. AppleScript is a dying technology that Apple barely cares about anymore. [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) is the modern replacement and where Apple is investing its automation efforts. Most of my apps support Shortcuts.

### Can you support non-Apple platforms?

No, my expertise is exclusively in macOS, iOS, watchOS, and visionOS. Focus is key to high-quality apps.

### Can I hire you to build me an app?

I am not available for hire.

### Can I acquire your app?

No. I make apps because I enjoy it. Your money is of no interest to me.
